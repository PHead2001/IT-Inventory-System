# Validation

package.json is the canonical command source. Iterate cheaply; certify the final candidate completely.

Start Supabase before database/full validation. Final certification runs fresh `npm ci` then `npm run validate`. E2E rebuilds with local public backend values because they are build inputs.

## Proof by layer

Unit/component tests cover strict room parsing, measured/default classifications, coordinate mapping, capability predicates, auth validation, explicit confirmation, and cookie refresh behavior.

pgTAP proves counts/categories, immutable identity, hierarchy integrity, role-based reads, direct-write denial and immediate deactivation. A separate real database integration test checks the exact 35-location fixture, room bindings/parents/capabilities, and concurrent hierarchy writers.

Playwright uses real local Supabase and the production Next server for login/logout, membership denial/deactivation, phone layout, captured invitation/recovery emails (including a deployment origin different from Site URL), password updates and token replay rejection. Do not substitute mocked Auth for this proof.

## Efficient iteration

Run affected tests first and reuse dependencies until dependency inputs change. No Supabase reset for isolated visuals. Schema, seed, RLS, function or persisted-contract changes require the clean DB gate. Preserve regressions; do not skip tests to achieve green checks.

CI builds the application with unreachable placeholder Supabase configuration. Its database/browser job runs disposable local Supabase on Ubuntu. This proves the local stack in CI, not that Docker is installed on a developer's laptop.

## Certification and provenance

PR jobs check out the exact head SHA. Main jobs report the actual post-merge SHA. The required aggregate fails when a required job fails or skips. After that aggregate succeeds on main, `Production database ready` fails closed unless explicitly enabled and fully configured, then checks the pinned project and migration history before and after forward delivery. It is a production Vercel Deployment Check, not a PR branch-protection check. Failure artifacts include reports, traces and regenerated types, never credentials/environment dumps.

Ready means: complete gates, exact-SHA green CI, clean worktree, local/remote HEAD agreement, latest fresh clean Codex review, and zero unresolved actionable threads. Verify a matching preview when configured. Code changes require new affected validation and fresh review.

Infrastructure failures are not passes. Report missing runtime/hosted prerequisites separately.

## Inventory Core proof

Focused Vitest suites cover mutation input normalization and stable error mapping, Server Action authorization, read contracts, structured history, partial/Move All confirmation, duplicate serial warnings, preserved retry identity and stale form baselines. Viewer route tests prove mutation controls are absent; PostgreSQL separately enforces authorization.

Inventory pgTAP tests cover RLS, direct-write grants, hardened RPC privileges, ordinary constraints and append-only history. Local integration tests exercise the complete quantity/asset transitions, event deltas, no-change observations, rollback, normalized idempotent replay/conflicts, authorization revocation, duplicate concurrent requests and competing stock moves. Read RPC tests verify literal search, stable location contracts, historical filters and bounded deterministic pagination.

Playwright proves the conventional staff workflows against real local persistence, including multi-location stock, partial/Move All moves, count correction, archive/restore, serialized transitions, duplicate warning, search/location/history, reload persistence, viewer restrictions and stale editing. Keep the existing real Auth workflows. A component mock is not a substitute for database or browser proof.

## Room proof

See [room navigation](room-navigation.md#validation) for graphics-specific contracts. `npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/room.spec.ts` forwards focused Playwright arguments while retaining the local backend build. The default `npm run validate` still runs every test. Real WebGL rendering/raycast interaction and forced graphics failure supplement pure and component tests; visual inspection is required for proportions and label readability.
